        <h3>‚è∞ Python Alarm Clock</h3>
        <p>This Python-based alarm clock allows users to set a specific time and plays a sound when the time is reached. It‚Äôs built with the <code>datetime</code> and <code>playsound</code> libraries.</p>
        <pre>
import datetime
import time
import playsound

alarm_time = "07:30"
while True:
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M")

        <h3> Turn Based battle </h3>
        <p> a Python turn-based battle game between a player and a computer-controlled monster, with special rules:

Player & monster: 100 HP each initially.

Choices:

Regular attack (available every turn) ‚Äî moderate damage.

Strong attack ‚Äî available every 3 turns only ‚Äî high damage.

Heal ‚Äî available every 5 turns only ‚Äî restores HP.

Damage/heal values random within ranges.

Monster attacks after player each turn.

If one reaches zero, declare a winner and ask to restart.

Here‚Äôs a clean Python implementation for this scenario: </p>
